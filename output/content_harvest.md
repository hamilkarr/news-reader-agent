## Article 1: I Predicted That Nvidia Would Beat the S&P 500 for the 3rd Consecutive Year in 2025. Here's Why the Streak Can Continue in 2026.

Nvidia continues to be a fundamentals-led growth story rather than one of hype and hot air. My prediction that Nvidia (NVDA) would beat the S&P 500 for the third consecutive year came true, as the artificial intelligence (AI) growth stock soared 38.9%, compared with a 16.4% gain for the index. Here's why Nvidia can beat the S&P 500 again in 2026.

In late October, Nvidia forecast that it would reach $500 billion in Blackwell and Rubin booked orders, including revenue that would be realized in fiscal 2026. At CES earlier this month, Nvidia said it would exceed its prior $500 billion guidance as orders continue to pour in. On Jan. 5, Nvidia released a press release announcing six new Rubin chips, including a graphics processing unit (GPU), a central processing unit, and various network, storage, and connectivity products. It also said Rubin is now in full production, with product deliveries coming in the second half of calendar year 2026.

In response, analysts are bumping up their earnings estimates. At the time of this writing, consensus analyst estimates call for fiscal 2026 earnings per share of $4.69 and $7.60 for fiscal 2027. Just six months ago, consensus estimates were $4.29 for fiscal 2026 and $5.76 for fiscal 2027 -- showcasing the impact of pulling forward Rubin earnings. Nvidia's fiscal 2027 ends in late January 2027, so the Rubin windfall is likely to begin in the second half of fiscal 2027.

Despite launching less than two years after Blackwell, Rubin has achieved massive efficiency improvements by packing more transistors per GPU and by leveraging what Nvidia calls "extreme codesign," which is basically another term for vertical integration across the entire technology stack, from rack-scale hardware solutions to software, algorithms, and physical infrastructure. In its CES presentation, Nvidia showed that its Rubin solution can achieve up to a 90% reduction in inference token cost and a 75% reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train AI models.

In sum, Nvidia can justify charging high prices for its Rubin products because they should improve performance, and therefore lower data center operating costs for customers. Nvidia's innovation should allow it to sustain high margin and hold its own against mounting competition. The bigger threat to the long-term investment thesis is demand. Nvidia's key customers are some of the most profitable companies in the world, with incredibly deep pockets. But eventually, they will need to convert capital expenditures into earnings to justify higher spending. In the meantime, demand for Rubin indicates that AI spending isn't slowing down, making Nvidia's 39 forward price-to-earnings ratio reasonable.

## Article 2: These 2 AI Stocks Could Join the $2 Trillion Club in 2026, According to Wall Street

The $2 trillion club currently has only five members: Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. This exclusive group could expand its membership this year, though. Two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are poised to join the $2 trillion club in 2026, according to Wall Street: Broadcom and Meta Platforms.

Semiconductor and infrastructure software company Broadcom (AVGO) has a market cap of roughly $1.7 trillion. It came very close to reaching the $2 trillion level in late 2025 but has since retreated by a double-digit percentage. Wall Street believes that Broadcom will rebound and then some this year. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects a potential upside of 29%. If Broadcom delivers a gain of this magnitude, its market cap would approach $2.2 trillion. Broadcom's AI chip growth is the main factor. CEO Hock Tan noted that AI semiconductor revenue soared 74% year-over-year. He expects AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion in Q1, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.

Meta Platforms (META) isn't too far behind Broadcom, with a market cap approaching $1.6 trillion. Like Broadcom, Meta almost joined the $2 trillion club last year before its stock declined somewhat. Analysts are even more bullish about Meta than they are for Broadcom. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock is around 32% above the current share price. Should Meta fulfill Wall Street's expectations, its market cap would easily top $2 trillion. Meta's early dominance of the AI smart glasses market has no doubt captured analysts' attention. So has the company's significant investment in developing AI superintelligence (ASI). AI is helping grow Meta's advertising revenue. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI recommendation systems led to users spending 5% more time on Facebook and 10% more time on Threads. The total time users spent watching videos on Instagram jumped more than 30% year-over-year.

Investors contended with bank earnings and geopolitical tensions this week, but the ongoing volatility may help uncover a few attractive stock picks. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street’s top pros: Broadcom, Airbnb, and Meta Platforms.

Broadcom (AVGO): Following an investor meeting with Charlie Kawwas at CES, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a buy rating with a $475 price target. Rasgon noted that concerns about rising competition are "hugely overblown" and that Broadcom is unlikely to be dethroned in the ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) space soon. Broadcom is expected to benefit from growing demand for Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs). TPU v7 shipments are expected to rise from hundreds of thousands in 2025 to "many many millions" in 2026.

Airbnb (ABNB): Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley named Airbnb as a top idea for 2026 with a $156 price target. He expects room nights growth to reaccelerate, driven by the addition of hotels and an upcoming AI product described as a "call option." Walmsley believes investors are underappreciating Airbnb’s prospects and its potential to use AI to improve the user experience and expand its addressable market.

Meta Platforms (META): Walmsley also named Meta as a top idea for 2026 with a $815 price target. He expects the stock to rise as the company demonstrates returns on its massive AI investment. Better advertising ROIs (return on investment) and the monetization of WhatsApp are key drivers. Strength in AI/ML (machine learning) engagement and ad targeting benefits are expected to bolster revenue growth in 2026. Walmsley expects Meta to roll out improved quality for its large language models, quelling fears about elevated capital spending.
