## Article 1: A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: Here's My Top AI Stock for 2026

AI is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity investors cannot afford to miss. Investment opportunities like this don't come around very often. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to make an impact that few technologies have. Massive gains from improved worker efficiency could bolster profits like we've never seen before, and investing in this lucrative field is a genius idea for investors. However, there are several ways to invest in AI, making it somewhat confusing as to where investors should start.

To me, there's one clear choice, and it has been the clear choice since 2023: Nvidia (NVDA 0.29%). Nvidia is leading the way with its cutting-edge computing hardware that is being deployed to train and run AI models. Even though its stock has risen a lot already, I think there's a generational investment opportunity that investors cannot afford to miss.

Nvidia is just getting started. Most investors, especially newer ones, will look at Nvidia's stock chart and assume they've missed the boat. After all, it has risen nearly 1,200% since 2023. That's known as price anchoring, and is a common trait that all humans exhibit. However, it can be dangerous for investors. Instead of looking at where you could have bought it years ago, investors must change their mindset and look at where it could go over the next few years. The market is a forward-looking machine, so investors must be also. Fortunately for prospective Nvidia investors, the artificial intelligence party is just getting started.

Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have a unique ability to process multiple calculations in parallel. This makes them ideally suited for tasks that require extreme computing power, like generative AI. However, GPUs have also been successfully deployed in other applications, like engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mining cryptocurrency. Still, nothing touches the GPU demand we're seeing from AI.

In 2025, Nvidia estimated that global data center capital expenditures totaled around $600 billion. However, that figure is expected to rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. While that projection may be easy for investors to brush off and think that Nvidia is just inflating the AI market more, I think investors should be a bit more accepting. Nvidia has more information about this market than nearly anyone else. It has also sold out of capacity for its cloud GPUs as of Q3. As a result, AI hyperscalers are ordering GPUs years in advance to secure their hardware when the time comes for it to be installed in a data center.

Should the 2030 market reach the $3 trillion level, Nvidia could be slated to produce $750 billion in revenue by 2030 if it maintains a 25% market share. That's a bold projection, but with Nvidia's history of producing leading equipment, I don't think it's out of the question. $750 billion in revenue would be more than triple what it's producing now, making the stock an excellent investment. AI is a generational investment opportunity, and Nvidia is my top way to capitalize on that in 2026.

## Article 2: 2026 May Be the Year of the Mega I.P.O.

For years, the initial public offering market has been a ghost town. But that could change in a big way in 2026. A group of the world’s most valuable and closely watched private companies — including SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic — have signaled to investors and employees that they are preparing for a potential stock market debut this year. If they follow through, it would represent a historic wave of I.P.O.s that could revitalize Silicon Valley’s venture capital ecosystem and provide a new set of high-growth options for stock market investors.

The potential listings come at a pivotal moment. While public markets have hit record highs, the engine of the tech economy — the process of private companies going public — has been stalled by high interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and a mismatch between private and public valuations. Now, the pressure to go public is reaching a boiling point. Venture capital firms, which have billions of dollars locked up in these “decacorns” (companies valued at over $10 billion), are under immense pressure from their own investors to return cash. Employees, some of whom have worked at these companies for a decade or more, are eager to finally sell their shares.

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has seen its valuation soar to more than $150 billion in private funding rounds. The company has recently taken steps to professionalize its financial operations, hiring a team of Wall Street veterans to lead its investor relations and compliance efforts — a classic signal that an I.P.O. is on the horizon. Anthropic, an A.I. safety and research company that competes with OpenAI, has also held discussions with banks about a possible listing. The company has raised billions from tech giants like Amazon and Google, and its backers are keen to see a public market valuation that reflects its rapid growth in the enterprise A.I. sector.

Then there is SpaceX, Elon Musk’s rocket company. While Mr. Musk has famously been wary of the public markets since his experience with Tesla, SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet business has become a massive, cash-generating machine. Analysts have long speculated that SpaceX could spin off Starlink as a public company, or that the parent company itself could go public to fund its ambitious Mars missions.

The return of the mega I.P.O. would be a boon for Wall Street banks, which have seen their investment banking fees crater during the downturn. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are already jockeying for lead roles on these potential deals. However, the road to a 2026 I.P.O. boom is not without risks. Investors remain wary of A.I. companies that burn through billions of dollars in cash with no clear path to profitability. If the first few major A.I. listings stumble, it could quickly shut the window for everyone else.

The technology sector is where you want to look for superior growth stocks in 2026. Cloud service providers continue to see insatiable demand for AI services. This is creating a strong demand environment for tech companies throughout the supply chain in the AI infrastructure market. Here are two AI stocks that can deliver wealth-building returns over the next decade.

1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is one of the top chip suppliers for the consumer PC market and data centers. Over the last two years, its revenue has grown at an annualized rate of over 20%, supporting rising share prices for investors. However, as AMD invests more in the AI infrastructure opportunity, management believes its growth will accelerate significantly. Wall Street analysts expect AMD to report $34 billion in revenue for 2025. AMD's long-term outlook calls for its annual revenue to grow 35% on a compound annual basis over the next three to five years. AMD enters 2026 with its largest business lines enjoying strong momentum. Data center revenue continues to grow strongly, reaching a record $4.3 billion in the third quarter. AMD expects its data center business to grow revenue at a rate of over 60% on an annualized basis in the next five years.

2. Microsoft (MSFT): Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a lucrative ecosystem of productivity tools, cloud services, and other professional services that serve a large base of users. Its subscription-based business model generates substantial revenue, which fuels investment in innovation. Microsoft spent $69 billion in capital expenditures over the last year, all of which was internally funded out of its $147 billion in trailing cash from operations. These investments have enabled the development of a world-class array of AI chips, systems, and cloud software. It's no surprise to see that Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 26% year over year in its most recently reported quarter, reaching $46 billion.

Microsoft 365, including Office software, has over 400 million paid subscribers, while its Copilot AI assistant has more than 100 million monthly active users. AI remains a key driver for the Microsoft Azure cloud business. Azure revenue grew 40% year over year last quarter, a remarkable growth rate for a company that generated $75 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025 (which ended in June). Microsoft is spending aggressively on AI infrastructure, while still reporting healthy profitability. Operating profit grew 24% year over year last quarter, higher than its 18% top-line growth rate. Microsoft's huge installed base of users and technology infrastructure will make it a formidable player in an AI-driven economy. Analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at a rate of 13% per year.
